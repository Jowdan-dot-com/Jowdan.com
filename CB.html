<p>Hey people, me (and my dad), are going to sell chromebooks with an OS (other then Chrome OS) on them</p>
</br>
<p>In the world with</p><a href=https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/chromebooks/chromebook-plus/galaxy-chromebook-plus-15-6-intel-core-3-256gb-neptune-blue-xe550xga-kc1us/?gQT=1>chromebooks that cost 625$ dollars</a>
<p> That only run Chrome OS. Well you get the Jist, with the help of</p> <a href=mrchromebox.tech>MrChromeBoxes Firmware</a> <p>You can install any OS with it, I would want to give you an OS of choice for the untech savy people but yeah. Buying for us is an alternitive to doing this yourself.</p>
</br>
<p>Which please if you are tech savy please do this yourself, go to the</p> <a href=https://docs.chrultrabook.com/>Chrultrabook Docs</a>
</br>  
<p>Yeah, but I haven't worked out the choosing OS, <i><b>YET</b></i> for now it's going to be Windows, don't worry linux users I am going to insert you soon enough, I mean linux in my opinon runs better on a chromebook then Windows.</p>
<p>Well we haven't even bought a chromebook yet so you'll have to wait.</p>
